# Apple Plant Disease Detection Using Deep Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a **Deep Learning-based system** to detect diseases in apple plants from leaf images. The system classifies leaves into healthy or diseased categories, helping farmers identify issues early and improve crop yield.

## Classes
The model classifies apple leaf images into the following categories:

- **Apple Scab (Apple___scab)** – Dark scabby lesions caused by fungal infection.  
- **Apple Black Rot (Apple___Black_rot)** – Blackened, rotting areas on leaves and fruits.  
- **Cedar Apple Rust (Apple___Cedar_apple_rust)** – Yellow-orange spots on leaves affecting fruit quality.  
- **Healthy (Apple___healthy)** – Leaves with no signs of disease.

## Dataset
- **Training images:** 6218  
- **Testing images:** 1553  

## Model Performance
- **Training Accuracy:** 90.93%  
- **Test Accuracy:** 91.93%  

## Conclusion
The model effectively distinguishes between different apple diseases and healthy leaves, providing a reliable tool for **automated disease detection** in apple orchards. Early detection helps reduce crop losses and improves overall apple production efficiency.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository  
2. Install required libraries: `tensorflow`, `numpy`, `keras`, `matplotlib`  
3. Run the training script or test your own apple leaf images using the trained model
